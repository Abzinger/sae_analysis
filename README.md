# sae_analysis 
This toolbox provides an information-theoretic analysis (IT-analysis) of sparse-autoencoders (SAEs). The current aim is to explore whether information-theortic signatures for the size of the dictionary size can be found. We plan to extend this toobox for more information-theretic analysis of SAEs. 

## Toolbox Backbone 
The toolbox modified the SAE training package [sparsify](https://github.com/EleutherAI/sparsify) by [EleutherAI](https://github.com/EleutherAI) to train its SAEs and generate the raw material for the IT-analysis. 
The toolbox implements IT-analysis measures such as degree of redundancy and degree of vulnerability introduced in this [paper]():
